## Mini-Project 1

Analysis of Birth Data from 2000 to 2014
This project will review birth data in the United States from 2000-2014. Variables given from this dataset include: `year`, `month`, `date_of_month`, the full date `date`, `day_of_week`, and `birth` count.

Births are a topic that can provide insight to many different aspects of citizen lifestyles over the years. As someone with an interest in health, birth data fits in the scope of birth rate, child mortality, quality of life and more. While this dataset does not offer those variables, it offers the opportunity to start small while not being overwhelmed by the data. 

Included in the .RMD and .html file is a report of findings along with 5 Data Visualizations that describe the data from US Births Dataset.
